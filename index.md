## Programming a controller for an air source heat pump heating / hot water system

### Points to note:
1. This is not an On/Off heating system. You set target temperatures at various points in the day. If you want the heating to stay off, program a low temperature (around 8 C).
2. The system heats water also. **MAKE SURE THAT THE HOT WATER AND HEATING ARE NOT ON AT THE SAME TIME!**
Why? Because, if they are both on, all the lovely hot water in the hot water cylinder will flow into the top floor underfloor heating. Your floor will be warm but your shower will be cold.
3. The hot water system is set to on or off: you don't set a target temperature.
3. Be careful around midnight: the controller gets mixed up if the system is on. To be on the safe side, make sure the system is switched off at 23.05, and switch it back on at 00.05.

### PREREQUISITES:
Before you program the system, make a written list of the settings you need. You'll get lost if you try to program the controller while you're figuring out what  target temperatures you should set.

### Steps
1. Tap the following buttons in this sequence: S, S, T, +, T
2. Set the target temperature for the first timepoint in the list. You can change the timepoints if necessary.
3. Tap + to take you to the next timepoint.
4. Keep going until you reach the last timepoint. Tap + to take you to the hot water settings.
5. Set the hot water to on or off at your chosen times. REMEMBER, DON'T RUN BOTH THE HOT WATER AND HEATING AT THE SAME TIME!
6. To exit, tap S,S,-, S.
7. To lock your settings (not advised), tap Help and S together; tap + to cycle through the lock options.
8. To view the controller metrics for the last 24 hours, tap Help.
